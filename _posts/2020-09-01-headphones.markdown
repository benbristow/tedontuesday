Ted says, "Bored? Listless? Need some excitement in your life? Experience all the thrills of being an heroic bomb disposal expert without any of the dangers by firstly pouring a bottle of water over your head to make it look like you're sweating profusely.Then don an old pair of headphones with the big earpieces before stopping your microwave oven with just one second to go!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
