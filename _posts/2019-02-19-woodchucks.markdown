<p>If I asked, “How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?” you might say, “A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.” </p>

<p>However, Ted says, “A woodchuck would chuck no amount of wood since a woodchuck can’t chuck wood.”</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.</p>

<p>Ted is very wise.</p>
