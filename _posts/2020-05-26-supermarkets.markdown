<p>Ted says, </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t waste your money buying stuff from supermarkets. I bought an Asda supreme lasagne and the instructions said “remove outer packaging and film lid” I pierced the lid and filmed it for a good 20 minutes and sod all happened! Then I went to Sainsburys to buy some orange juice. It said concentrate, so I stared at the carton for 20 minutes and bugger all happened to that either. What a rip!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
