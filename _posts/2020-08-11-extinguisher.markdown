<p>Ted says, &quot;Always use the correct fire extinguisher for the relevant type of fire. For instance use water on burning wood and use CO2 on electrical equipment. Whatever you do, DON&#39;T fight a fire with fire. You&#39;ll only get a much bigger fire!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
