<p>Ted says, &quot;Are you a bit short of money because of being furloughed by the coronavirus?&quot;
&quot;Make up your lost 20% in wages by first getting yourself a premium rate phone number. Then display the number in the back window of your car with a sign that says,&quot; How&#39;s my driving?&quot;
Finally, drive around town like a complete ar**hole for an hour or two and watch the money pour in!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
But sometimes highly irresponsible!</p>
