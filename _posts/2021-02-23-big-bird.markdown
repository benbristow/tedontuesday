Ted says, 

"If someone is treating you unkindly, just stop and pause for reflection for a minute. That someone is merely reacting to their own unresolved problems which have nothing to do with you or what you have done. Then, on due reflection, give them the big bird!" 😁

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
