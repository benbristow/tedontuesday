Ted says, "Have fun in the supermarket next time you go alcohol shopping. Fill you trolley to bursting point with booze, then add one packet of nappies. When paying, pretend that you don't have enough money and put the nappies back. Watch the disapproving faces of the checkout personnel and have a good old chuckle!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise (and a tad mischievous!)
