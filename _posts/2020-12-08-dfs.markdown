Ted says, 

"Recreate a game of Pacman by hurrying down the isles in DFS whilst trying to avoid the salesmen.

Turn the tables by producing your, "I've got a complaint!" letter above your head, then try to stop them as they instantly change their demeanour and skulk away to the nearest staff only exit."

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
