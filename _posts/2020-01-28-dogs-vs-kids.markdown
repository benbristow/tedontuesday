<p>Ted says, </p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever considered making the choice between dogs or kids? Here are 5 reasons you should choose dogs.&quot;</p>

<p>1 - You can house train a dog quicker.</p>

<p>2 - Dogs don&#39;t whine when they don&#39;t get what they want.</p>

<p>3 - You can send a dog to bed when they&#39;re naughty and they won&#39;t stamp their feet and pretend cry for hours on end.</p>

<p>4 - You can leave a dog home alone.</p>

<p>5 - You can neuter or spay a dog!</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
