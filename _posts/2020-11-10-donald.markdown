Ted says, 

"It is said that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter for an infinite amount of time will eventually write the complete works of Shakespeare.
Therefore it stands to reason, all Donald Trump needs to be considered the greatest US president ever is an infinite amount of time and a monkey that can type. Good luck with that Donald!" 😁

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
