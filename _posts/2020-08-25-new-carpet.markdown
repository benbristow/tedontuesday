<p>Ted says, &quot;Do you love the bouncy feel of a new, luxurious carpet but can&#39;t afford to buy a new Axminster?
Simply take home a sampler of the best shagpile from Carpet Warehouse. Cut out insoles in your size, insert them into your slippers and you&#39;ll feel like you&#39;ve re-carpeted the whole house! Enhance the experience by threading the sampler cut offs on to a piece of string thus creating yourself a wonderfully unique necklace complete with that newly fitted carpet aroma.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted. Ted is very wise.</p>
