<p>Ted says, &quot;Did you ever wonder why we love sticking our heads outside fast moving car windows but hate having you humans blow in our faces?&quot;
&quot;Well, we love the views and the wind blowing a plethora of wonderful different aromas into our noses when in a car, but hate it when you lot get in our faces and blow human dogs breath all over us!&quot; &quot;THAT&#39;S WHY!&quot; ðŸ˜¡</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
