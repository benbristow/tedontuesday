<p>Ted says, </p>

<p>&quot;If people treat you unkindly, just STOP, breathe deeply and ponder this for a minute. They are only reacting to their own unresolved problems and it has TRULY nothing to do with you or what you have done... Then turn around and give them the finger!&quot; ðŸ–•</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
