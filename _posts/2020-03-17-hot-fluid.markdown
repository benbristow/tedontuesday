<p>Ted says, &quot;Avoid running around burning your lips and throat drinking expensive boiling hot watered down fluid from a scalding plastic cup through a little hole, by getting up 10 minutes earlier and making yourself a nice cheap cup of coffee at home before you go to work.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
