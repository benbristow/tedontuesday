<p>Ted says, </p>

<p>&quot;I have sent a letter to all the ready meal and frozen food manufacturers. It reads as follows,</p>

<p>&quot;Why do all your products have to cook on the middle shelf of the oven? My middle shelf is jam packed at tea time. Design food that can be cooked on the top and bottom shelves as well the middle one and and I&#39;m sure youâ€™ll make yourselves a fortune! Kind regards, Ted.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What do you, my fans think of my letter?&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
