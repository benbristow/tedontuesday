<p>Ted says, &quot;Last week I went to an AA meeting and everyone stood up and admitted to being an alcoholic. I couldn&#39;t believe it! If you&#39;re a driver, I&#39;d cancel your membership and join the RAC if you want responsible, sober mechanics mending your car!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
