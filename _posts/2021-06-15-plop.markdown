Ted says, "When you are using a public toilet and realise the person in the next cubicle is holding fire until you've gone, pretend to leave by opening and closing the main door after you've washed your hands. Then when you hear the first plop you can give them a huge cheer and laugh out loud!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
(and sometimes a little mischievous!)
