<p>&quot;As Christmas approaches be careful about drink driving as the police are out randomly stop checking...</p>

<p>Last night I was out for a few drinks and one thing led to another and I had a few too many. 
Knowing I was over the limit I decided to leave the car at the pub and took a bus home. I passed the police check point but because I was in a bus they just waved it past.
I didn&#39;t have an accident and arrived home safely which was a real surprise to me because I&#39;ve never driven a bus before and heaven knows where I took it from!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise. (USUALLY!)</p>
