Ted says, "Relive the old fashioned experience of social networks like instagram and tumblr without the use of a computer or phone by printing off pictures of your cat, any meals you've eaten or exotic cocktails you've drunk, and wandering around showing them to strangers in the street!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
