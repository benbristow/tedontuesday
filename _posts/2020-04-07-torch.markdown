<p>Ted says,
&quot;Are you fed up of looking at your partner&#39;s permenantly miserable face caused by the coronavirus lockdown?&quot;
&quot;Would you like to see that frown turn upside down?&quot;
&quot;Well, just force them to swallow a small high powered torch and then sit back and watch as their little faces light up!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
