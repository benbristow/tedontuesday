<p>Ted says, &quot;It&#39;s Christmas eve and you should all be full of festive spirit, happy, and &quot;Ho, Ho, Ho-ing.&quot; But I just hope on New Year&#39;s Day you won&#39;t all be looking at your bank statements in horror and be, &quot;No, No, No-ing,&quot; and shortly after, &quot;Boo, Hoo, Hoo-ing!&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
