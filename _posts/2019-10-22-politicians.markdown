<p>Ted is getting angry with and has had enough of our politicians....</p>

<p>Ted says, &quot;In life and in particular with politicians, it is far wiser to judge people by their deeds and their track record rather than their false words and their empty promises.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
