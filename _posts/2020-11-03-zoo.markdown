Ted says,

"Are you fed up and feeling a little mischievous?"
"Cause enormous panic at your local zoo by running around with a replica rifle, a look of extreme anguish on your face and frantically asking everyone you see, "Which way did it go?""

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
(and very naughty sometimes!)
