Ted says, "Before you go to bed, pour cornflakes around on all the ground floors. You can then sleep sound in the knowledge that if any burglar enters your property you will instantly be woken by the loud crunching sound as they try to sneak around.
As an added bonus, when you wake up you will have a hearty breakfast waiting for you as soon as you go downstairs!"
