<p>Ted says,</p>

<p>&quot;God created heaven on earth in six days and rested on the seventh. You would think his followers would show respect by doing the Christian thing and letting him have a lie in on Sundays. But oh no, they bother him at the crack of dawn every bloomin&#39; week with their noisy organ songs and prayers asking him to sort out stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tsk! Some people eh?&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
