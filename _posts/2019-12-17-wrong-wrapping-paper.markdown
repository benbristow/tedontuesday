<p>Ted says, &quot;If you inadvertently used the wrong wrapping paper in a mad rush to get all the presents wrapped for Christmas, don&#39;t despair.&quot; 
Just use a marker pen and add the word,&quot; Jesus&quot; to the words, &quot;Happy Birthday!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
