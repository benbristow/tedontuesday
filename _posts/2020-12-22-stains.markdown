Ted says,

"Before attempting to remove stubborn stains from a garment, always circle the soiled area with a permanent pen so that when you remove it from the washing machine you can easily locate the area and check that the stain has gone!"

Merry Christmas to all my fans.
I love you all. ❤️🎅🎄❤️

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise
