Ted says, 

"I was shocked to hear the home secretary say that the prison population has been ballooning for the past 10 years. I don't think this is right. People are sent to jail to be punished, not to be given 'thrill of a lifetime' experiences that most normal law abiding citizens can only dream of!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
