<p>Ted says,</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have trouble remembering where you parked your car in crowded carparks? Leave your headlights on full and just wait for nightfall. Hey Presto, there&#39;s your car!
Bonus tip. Always keep a fully charged 12v battery in the boot of your car. You never know when you might need one!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
