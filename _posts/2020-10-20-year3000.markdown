Ted says, "Are you worried about Corona wiping the planet out? Donâ€™t be, because Busted have been to the year 3000 and not much has changed. Although they do live underwater but that's due to climate change apparently. So that probably wasn't a hoax and definitely not a symptom of Covid....Although everything else seems to be!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
