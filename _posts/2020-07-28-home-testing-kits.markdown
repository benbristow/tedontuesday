<p>Ted says, </p>

<p>&quot;Don&#39;t buy expensive COVID-19 home testing kits, just follow my simple advice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take a glass full of your favourite tipple, eg whisky,  gin, rum and sniff it. If you can smell it then you&#39;re halfway there. Now take a big sip. If you can taste it you don&#39;t have the virus!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You must test yourself regularly, say every 5 minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;However, if you wake up the next morning with a bad headache this is one of the symptoms of Coronavirus so you will have to repeat the tests again tonight!&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise</p>
