<p>&quot;January is cold and bleak.
You&#39;re fat and broke after the festivities.
You&#39;ve turned a whiter shade of pale and you can&#39;t feel your face from the biting winds.
That is, unless, you&#39;ve got a fur coat!
So my advice to you this week is get yourself a nice thick winter coat by growing fur. Grow it all over like me and grow it before the snow starts falling.....
Alternatively get yourself a nice thick winter coat!&quot;</p>
