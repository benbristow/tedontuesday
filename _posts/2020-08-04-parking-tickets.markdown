<p>Ted says,</p>

<p>&quot;Do you want to avoid hefty parking fine tickets being slapped on your windscreen? Then make sure you always keep a glass cutter and a tube of superglue in your pocket or handbag. When you park your car just cut out your windscreen and take it with you and then simply glue it back in place when you return.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
