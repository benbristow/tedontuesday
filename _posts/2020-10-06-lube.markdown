Ted says, "Always carry a small pack of butter just incase you get your head stuck in some railings. You can use it to free yourself, or someone else can use it as lube. ðŸ˜‰

If you forget the butter, then simply take the precaution of walking on the road well away from them. This works pretty well as I've never got my head stuck in railings and have only been knocked down twice!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
