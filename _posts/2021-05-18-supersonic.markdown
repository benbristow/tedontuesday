Ted says,

"Convince people you are a Superhero and can travel faster than the speed of sound by standing facing them about 20 foot away and silently mouthing the word 'Supersonic.' Then run towards them as fast as you can and say the word 'Supersonic' without moving your lips!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
