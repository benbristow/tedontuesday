<p>&quot;Tomorrow, you will open a book and its pages will be blank.
You are going to put words on them yourself.
The book will be called, Hope, Opportunity and the Future &quot;
The first chapter will be called,&quot; New Year&#39;s Day.&quot;
Write your words well. Write your words wisely.&quot;</p>

<p>Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.</p>
