Ted says, "Next time you go paintballing don't be persuaded in to buying loads of expensive extra pellets. Instead, when you've run out of ammo, simply attach a freshly dipped paint brush to the end of your shotgun, then run and scream menacingly at your opponents using it as a cheap but effective home made bayonet!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
