Ted says, 

"An arrow cannot be fired until the bow has been drawn back fully. If life is dragging you back and is full of tension, it means you're ready to shoot at your target. So draw a deep breath, take aim, hold steady and fire straight and true at your dream!"

Listen to Ted.
Ted is very wise.
